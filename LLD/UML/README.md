# Unified Modeling Language (UML)

UML is like the blueprint of software.
Instead of confusing people with code, we use diagrams to show how a system works — just like an architect sketches before building a house.

But here’s the catch UML has 14 diagram types.
In interviews (and real life), you don’t need all of them.

### The top 5 UML diagrams you should know:

- Class Diagram

- Use Case Diagram

- Sequence Diagram

- Activity Diagram

- Component Diagram
